Exercise Set #2

The REPL is the simplest way to execute Python code. 
If you enter a statement into the REPL, it will execute it.
If you enter an expression into the REPL, it will evaluate it and print the resulting value.
Any variables you define will be stored until you close the REPL (CTRL+D). 

WARM UPS (Type given code directly into the REPL)

1. String comparison is case-sensitive. Try typing: "bob" == "Bob"
2. However, you can safely compare across ints and floats. Try typing: 1 == 1.0
3. Type the following to define an empty list: my_list = []
4. Add integers to your list with code like the following: my_list.append(9)
5. Pop a number off of your list: my_list.pop()
5. You can use the "in" operator to check if something appears in a string or list. Type: "i" in "team"  
6. You can use .split() to break up a string on whitespace! Try using it on this string: "Luke I am your father"

EXERCISES (Solve on your own or with a partner)

1. Lists can hold ANY kind of data! Type my_list = [], then try appending an int, a float, a string and another list!
2. Create a list from scratch containing the same elements, using a "literal" like the following: [1, 2.0, "three"]
3. Can't spell success without "u"! Grab the second letter of the string "success" using its index.
4. Write code to check if two strings are anagrams of each other, i.e. a rearrangement of the same letters. Hint: Use sorted() to put a string into alphabetical order.
5. Create a variable called any_number, and set it to any integer. How can you test if any_number is an even number? How about testing if it is odd? 

BONUS

1. Did you know there is a third slot in the slice syntax? E.g., the slice [::2] will grab every even-indexed character from the underlying string. Can you use this to reverse a string?
2. If Python expects a Boolean and gets something else, it defaults to True. However, within each data type and structure we've studied -- string, int, float, list -- there is exactly one value that evaluates to False. Can you find the "false-y" value for each of these? Use bool() to check.
