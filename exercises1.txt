Exercise Set #1

The REPL is the simplest way to run Python code. 
If you enter a statement into the REPL, it will simply execute it.
If you enter an expression into the REPL, it will evaluate it and print the resulting value.
Any variables you define will be stored until you close the REPL (CTRL+D). 

WARM UPS (Type given code directly into the REPL)

1. print("Hello world!")
2. jedi = "Obi-wan Kenobi"
3. f"Help me {jedi}! You're my only hope."
4. Variables can be overwritten. Enter number_of_planets = 9, then enter number_of_planets = 8.
5. Compute the number of seconds in a year, by multiplying the number of seconds, minutes, hours and days: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365

EXERCISES (Solve on your own or with a partner)

1. Create a variable my_name that equals your name. Then make the computer greet you by name, using an f-string. 

* So if my name was Tom, the computer would print "Hello, Tom!" 
* If you get stuck, look back at warm ups 2 and 3. 

2. Calculate the tip for your dinner

* Create a variable called dinner_bill, which equals 40. 
* When it's time to tip, how would you use Python to find 15% of your dinner bill? 
* How about 20%?

3. Multiplication works with strings too! 

* For example, 2 * "tu" results in "tutu". 
* Use string addition and multiplication to construct "mississippi"!

BONUS

1. Create a Madlib using an f-string! 

* A Madlib is a story where certain nouns, adjectives or verbs are left out. 
* When you leave out a noun for example, leave a slot like {noun1}.
* Write your string here or in another text file.
* Tell someone else to define variables noun1, etc for the missing words.
* Paste your f-string into the REPL!

2. Calculate how many possible six-character passwords there are, if only lowercase letters, uppercase letters and numbers are allowed.
